<br>

**Learning Points**
* Importance of modularizing Code Base
* Making full use of factory functions
* Worked with 2D arrays in Javascript
* Reviewed `.forEach`, `.filter`, `.map` object methods
* Worked with arrow functions
* Used Ternary Statements `case ? case1 : case2`
* Utilized encapsulation techniques through closure
* Avoided global code
* Seen the benefits of callback functions
<br>


## What I added to this project:
- [X] *Create win conditions for the console and DOM versions*
- [X] *Create intro screen where players can enter their name*
- [X] *Create a winner screen
- [X] *Add styling/utilize CSS Grid capabilities to display board game*
<br>

## Coming back to add:
- [ ] *Game Over/ Play Again Screen*
- [ ] *Light up cells function*
- [ ] *Functionality that makes the winning cell indexes dissapear when a player has won*
- [ ] *Create a screen to ask the user if he/she wants to play again*
- [ ] *Refactor code, and optimize*
- [ ] *Find a way to include my original algorithm for checking if a player got four in a row.*

**Project TakeAways**
* Seen the direct impact of writing modular code, as it prevented me from repeating a lot of unneccessary code
* Was able to utilize javascripts different function types: function expressions, and arrow functions*
* Gained extensive practice on manipulating the DOM using javascript 
* Gained a lot of practice of javascripts different array methods, especially the `.forEach` method, which was useful for working with 2D arrays
* Utilized factory functions in order to prevent repetitive code that could of occurred if I had used regular objects
* Used some functions as "controllers" which controlled a sections of the code base, and provided easier debugging
* Was able to create private members and variables by only returning certain information from factory functions
* Created my first simple animation using javascript and css, by using javascripts `setTimeOut` and `setInterval` functions
